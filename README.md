# Natural Language Processing

This repository contains implementations of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in Python, and the code is organized into different directories for easy navigation and understanding.

## Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

Hidden Markov Models are statistical models used for representing the probability distributions over sequences of observations. They are widely used in various applications such as speech recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and bioinformatics.

### Implementation

- Initialization of state transition and observation matrices.
- Forward and backward algorithms for evaluating probabilities.
- Viterbi algorithm for decoding the most likely sequence of states.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition is the process of identifying and classifying named entities (like persons, organizations, locations, dates, etc.) in text. This is a crucial task for many NLP applications such as information retrieval and question answering.

### Implementation

- Preprocessing of text data.
- Training and evaluation of NER models using popular libraries.
- Custom NER model implementation using machine learning algorithms.

## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. It is widely used in social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more.

### Implementation

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF.
- Model training using classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.
- Evaluation of model performance.

## Nueral Machine Translation (NMT)

Neural Machine Translation involves using neural network models to translate text from one language to another. This approach has significantly improved the quality of machine translation systems.

### Implementation

- Data preprocessing including tokenization and sequence padding.
- Building encoder-decoder models with attention mechanisms.
- Training the NMT model on parallel corpora.
- Evaluating the translation quality using BLEU scores.
